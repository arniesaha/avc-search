## Google Custom Search API Example  
###  Using MEAN.io Framework

Google Custom Search API example, build on top of **MEAN.io** framework. Example of calling a third-party Web API from a MEAN stack application. Call a Web API from the client-side (AngularJS), and also from the backend (Node.js). This project requires you to create a Google API key and Google search engine ID.

#### Preview
[![Custom Search API](https://github.com/garystafford/meanio-custom-search/blob/nodesearch/previews/CustomSearchExample_preview.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/garystafford/meanio-custom-search/blob/nodesearch/previews/CustomSearchExample.png?raw=true)

#### Branches
##### master
Google Custom Search API is called from the client-side by an AngularJS factory. You will need to create a `cse_config.json` file to hold your own `search engine id` and `API key` values. See notes below. Note, this method exposes your private API key. It is only only intended for demonstration purposes.

##### nodesearch (ACTIVE)
Google Custom Search API is called from the backend by Node.js. Node.js then exposes a restful end-point (i.e. `http://localhost:3000/search/foo`), which is called from the client-side by an AngularJS factory. You will need to create two environment variables to hold your own `search engine id` and `API key` values. See notes below. This method protects your private `API key` from exposure on the client-side.

#### Commands
To use this GitHub project, these are the commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/garystafford/meanio-custom-search.git
cd meanio-custom-search
npm install
```

Or, to re-create the project yourself, these are the commands used to setup MEAN.io and create `search` package:
```
sudo npm install -g mean-cli
mean init meanio-custom-search
cd meanio-custom-search
npm install
mean package search  
```
If you are using the `nodesearch` branch (Node.js), create two environmental variables, `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` and `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, to hold your own `search engine id` and `API key` values.
If you are using the `master` branch (AngularJS), add your own `search engine id` and `API key` values to the `packages/custom/search/public/assets/cse_config.json` file. This file is not included in repository, since these values should be kept private.
```
{
    "cse_id" : "<your_search_engine_id>",
    "api_key": "<your_api_key>"
}
```
To start the MEAN.io application, run `grunt` or `node server`. Open your web browser to `http://localhost:3000/#!/search/example`.
